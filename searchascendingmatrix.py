Search In An Ascending Matrix
February 10, 2012

Todayâ€™s exercise is taken from our inexhaustible list of interview questions:

Given an m by n matrix of integers with each row and column in ascending order,
search the matrix and find the row and column where a key k appears, or report
that k is not in the matrix. For instance, in the matrix

 1  5  7  9
 4  6 10 15
 8 11 12 19
14 16 18 21

the key 11 appears in row 2, column 1 (indexing from 0) and the key 13 is not
present in the matrix. The obvious algorithm takes time O(m x n) to search the
matrix row-by-row, but you must exploit the order in the matrix to find an
algorithm that takes time O(m + n).

Your task is to write the requested search function.

    """ We loop over the diagonal elements looking for the first one greather
        than the number.Then, we carry out a linear search over the elements
        from the previous diagonal element -what we refer to as pivot- and
        the current one. It is easily seen that this algorithm is O(m + n). """
